# Istallation steps:
### Instal OpenAI Gym
```
pip install gym
```
### Install Gridworld environment
```
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ Gridworld==0.0.1
```
Things to note about environments:
```
  env needs to equal the gym.make()
  env.observation_space.n is the states
  env.action_space.n is the actions
  env.reset() is necessary to restart the environment progress
  env.render() will help with rendering current environment after each step
```
```
Funny Josh Notes:
Taxi would make a far better approximator of MAXQ's power, just like the paper.
